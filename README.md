Project for uploading photos.
I have used html, css and php to develop this project.
The user can select any photo with extensions as .jpg, .png and .jpeg
Once the photo is selected and uploaded, the photo can be seen in a card format upon the webpage.
The users can upload as many photos as they want and can see the photos going in an increasing order of 3's (3,6,9,12..)
The photos are stored in a local file that can be accessed by selecting the right path.
Visible changes are also seen in real time on phpmyadmin using SQL queries.
Thank you for giving me this opportunity and I hope you like it.
